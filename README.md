# Advent of Code 2021 in Java

This is my advent of code repo for December 2021, all solutions are in Java this year. 

In each folder you can find the description, input and the program in a neat structure. 

If you want more information about AoC, have a look at their [about section](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about).

Holiday wishes,

Adam Varg Barvesten
